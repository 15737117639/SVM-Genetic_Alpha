# Genetic_SVM Alpha


This is derivative work from literature review of a paper, intending to serve as main alpha for the research project developed under ETC Investment Group, Academy Division. The underlying logic and technique follows through with the abstract:

"This paper presents an integrated approach for portfolio selection in a multicriteria
decision making framework. Firstly, we use Support Vector Machines for classifying
financial assets in three pre-defined classes, based on their performance on some key financial
criteria. Next, we employ Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm to solve a mathematical model of
the multicriteria portfolio selection problem in the respective classes incorporating investorpreferences."

Model:
-Multicriteria portfolio selection model developed by Gupta et al.
  can yield positive results despite a deficit in areas of return and risk
-Traditional Markowitz model

Multiobjective programming model for asset portfolio allocation
1. Tools and algorithms:
  Support Vector Machine
  Real Coded Genetic Algorithm
2. Parameters:
  Short-term returns (12-month period)
  Long-term returns(36-month period)
  Risk
  Liquidity
